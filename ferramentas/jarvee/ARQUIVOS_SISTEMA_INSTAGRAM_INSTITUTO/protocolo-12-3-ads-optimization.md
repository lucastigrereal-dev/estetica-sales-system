## 9. A/B TESTING

**One variable at a time:**

**Test 1: Creative** (same audience)
- A vs B (100 clicks each)
- Winner implemented

**Test 2: Audience** (same creative)
- Lookalike vs Interest
- Winner gets 2x budget

**Test 3: CTA** (same creative)
- "Follow" vs "Learn More"
- Winner used consistently

## 10. PROFITABILITY CALC

**Example (followers):**
```
Cost/follower: $0.50
New followers: 1000
Cost: $500

Email conversion: 5% = 50 emails
LTV per email: $50 = $2500
ROAS: $2500/$500 = 5:1 ✅

Strategy: Reinvest in more ads
```
